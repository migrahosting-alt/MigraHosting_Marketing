# MIGRA ECOSYSTEM - MARKETING BLURBS

Ready-to-paste marketing blurbs for each product pricing section.

---

## A. Shared Hosting – MigraHosting

### Under Pricing Table Blurb

### Why choose MigraHosting over the big guys?

- **Fair pricing that doesn't jump at renewal.** Our long-term prices stay close to what you see on day one. No "promo then double" tricks.
- **Real resources on NVMe.** Your site lives on fast NVMe SSD storage with carefully tuned limits instead of overcrowded cheap servers.
- **Everything you actually need is included.** Free SSL, daily backups, 1-year free domain and WHOIS privacy on yearly Starter+ plans.
- **Serious email, not an afterthought.** Your website pairs with our dedicated MigraMail server for more reliable delivery.

From a free Student plan (with academic verification) to Business plans for agencies, MigraHosting gives you the same core infrastructure as big-name hosts—at a slightly better price and with less nonsense.

## B. Managed WordPress – MigraWP

### Under Pricing Table Blurb

### Why MigraWP instead of "do-it-yourself" WordPress hosting?

- **We manage updates for you.** No more worrying about when to update core, plugins, or themes—we follow a safe policy and handle it.
- **Performance tuned from day one.** OpenLiteSpeed, cache, PHP and database tuned specifically for WordPress and WooCommerce.
- **Built-in protection.** MigraGuard rules help block brute-force attempts, suspicious logins, and common attack patterns.
- **Backups you can rely on.** Daily backups with increasing retention (7 to 30 days) depending on your plan.

MigraWP is for people who want WordPress to be boring and predictable: fast, secure, backed up, and handled by a team that works with it every day.

## C. Email – MigraMail

### Under Pricing Table Blurb

### Why trust MigraMail with your business email?

- **Your domain, done right.** We set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC so your messages look legitimate to other providers.
- **Dedicated mail server.** Your email runs on a server designed for mail, not as a tiny feature stuffed into a shared hosting box.
- **Works with your favorite apps.** Outlook, Apple Mail, iOS/Android mail apps, and browser-based webmail are all supported.
- **Scales as you grow.** Start with a few mailboxes on Basic and move up to Pro or Business when your team or agency grows.

MigraMail gives you professional business email without forcing you into a huge productivity suite—at a price that makes sense per mailbox.

## D. VPS & Cloud – MigraVPS / MigraCloud

### Under Pricing Table Blurb

### Why run your servers on MigraVPS & MigraCloud?

- **Clean, NVMe-powered nodes.** Your VPS or cloud instance lives on modern Proxmox nodes with NVMe storage and fair resource isolation.
- **Root access when you need it.** You're free to install your stack, deploy containers, or run APIs the way you want.
- **Backups and safety nets.** Proxmox snapshots and external backups (according to your plan and setup) help you recover fast if something breaks.
- **Same team, full stack.** The same people who manage your hosting, email, and DNS understand what's running on your server.

Use MigraVPS for predictable workloads and MigraCloud when you need more headroom, scaling options, and higher-availability patterns.

## E. Cloud Storage – MigraDrive / MigraStorage

### Under Pricing Table Blurb

### Why trust MigraDrive with your files and backups?

- **Simple per-tier pricing.** No surprise per-GB fees. Pick Personal, Team, or Business and know exactly what you'll pay.

MigraDrive is cloud storage that lives inside the Migra ecosystem—so backups, file sharing, and app storage all work together.
