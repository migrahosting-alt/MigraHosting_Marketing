# COPILOT BRIEF – CLOUD STORAGE PAGE (MigraDrive / MigraStorage)

## Goal
Create a page for **MigraDrive** (cloud storage) and **MigraStorage** (backend branding).

## Plans
- **Personal**: 250GB, $3.95/mo (yearly) - 1 user
- **Team**: 1TB, $11.95/mo (yearly) - Up to 5 users (Most Popular)
- **Business**: 3TB, $31.95/mo (yearly) - Up to 15 users

## Key Points
- Similar to Google Drive / Dropbox for end users
- **S3-compatible object storage** for developers/backups
- **Integrated with Migra ecosystem** (hosting, VPS backups)
- No per-user fees (pay for storage only)

## Page Structure

### 1. Hero
**Headline**: "Cloud storage that lives in your hosting ecosystem."
**Subheadline**: "Store docs, photos, and backups on MigraDrive. S3-compatible access for your apps."
**CTAs**: "Choose Your Plan" / "See Developer Docs"

### 2. Pricing Section
Component: `<StoragePricingSection />`

### 3. Use Cases Section
1. **Individuals**: Backing up photos/docs
2. **Teams**: Sharing client deliverables
3. **Developers**: Using S3 buckets for app assets and backups
4. **Hosting & VPS backups**: Targeted to MigraStorage

### 4. How It Works Section
- MinIO/S3-style backend (concept)
- MigraDrive web interface (modern, responsive)
- Desktop sync clients (Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Mobile apps (iOS, Android)
- Role-based access for Team/Business plans

### 5. FAQ
**Q: Is this a full Google Drive replacement?**
A: For file storage and sharing, yes. For real-time collaboration (Google Docs-style editing), no. We focus on secure storage and S3 API access.

**Q: Can I map it on my desktop?**
A: Yes. Desktop sync client (like Dropbox) available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

**Q: Can my hosting backups be stored here automatically?**
A: Yes! MigraHosting, MigraWP, and VPS can auto-backup to MigraDrive. Configure in mPanel.

## Tone
- Friendly and modern
- Emphasize **integration** with everything else Migra offers
- Position as "all-in-one ecosystem" advantage

## Competitor Context
**vs Dropbox**: 60% lower cost, no per-user fees, S3-compatible API
**vs Google Drive**: Better privacy (no ads), S3 API, integrated with hosting
**vs AWS S3**: Simpler pricing, easier to use, better for non-technical users
